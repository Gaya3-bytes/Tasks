                As a child, I enjoyed reading about space and had a collection of children's
                 astronomy books. At a young age, I learned that living in Los Angeles County also meant that I'd have a limited view of the skies. 

                Though I was able to visit the Griffith Observatory from time to time, 
                I rarely had a good view of the night sky. Instead, I'd visit mountains over Los Angeles where I could look down to see lights coming from the city. It's a cool sight, but it doesn't compare to what space has waiting for us.

                I owned a cheap pair of binoculars, but these didn't help much beyond making it clear how big a problem light pollution is for urban skywatchers.
