        But it's unclear at the moment what the new results actually mean, discovery team members stressed. Venusian microbes may be emitting the phosphine, but it's also possible that the stuff is being generated by exotic chemical reactions that we don't understand, and that have nothing to do with life.

"We have what could be a biosignature, and a plausible story about how it got there," Pete Worden, executive director of the nonprofit Breakthrough Initiatives, said in a statement. "The next step is to do the basic science needed to thoroughly investigate the evidence and consider how best to confirm and expand on the possibility of life."
